**Host Address:**
-   Enter the **host address** of the SAP ABAP system. This is typically the **IP address** or **DNS name** of the SAP server. You can obtain this from the system administrator or from the SAP system's network settings.

**Instance Number:** 
-   Enter the **instance number** assigned to your SAP ABAP system. This is a 3-digit number (e.g., 00, 01) used to identify the SAP system instance. You can find this in the SAP GUI or ask your system administrator for this value.

**User:**
-   Enter the **SAP username** you use to log in to the SAP system. Ensure that the username has the necessary permissions for accessing the system. This can be the same username you use to log in via the SAP GUI. If you don't have one, contact the system administrator to create or provide it.

**Client Number:**
-   Enter the **client number** for the SAP system. This is typically a 3-digit number (e.g., 100, 200) used to identify the logical client within the system. You can obtain this from the SAP GUI or ask your system administrator.

**Password:**
-   Enter the **password** associated with the SAP username. This is the same password you use when logging into the SAP system.

## 3. Test the connection:

-   Click the **"Test Connection"** button to verify that the connection to the SAP ABAP system is working correctly.
