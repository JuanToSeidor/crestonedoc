## Sections
Jobs are the core of the platform. They function as a visual canvas where you can drag and connect pre-configured nodes, defining the execution flow of your data export process.

Each job controls how and when data is moved from SAP or other sources to different destinations, allowing you to sequence multiple subsequent steps in a single execution.

The true potential of jobs lies in their automated scheduling capability, facilitating periodic uploads and minimizing manual intervention.
