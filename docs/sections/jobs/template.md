## Create a Job Using a Template
If you're looking to accelerate the creation of your jobs without starting from scratch, the template module offers a guided and automated way to configure full workflows based on predefined SAP modules. This feature helps you streamline data extraction and loading by generating all necessary nodes and jobs in just a few steps.

## Step-by-step Process

### 1. Select "Module Templates" from the Add New Job Menu
From the main dashboard or job list, click "Add New Job" and choose the "Module Templates" option. This starts the guided creation process using a predefined SAP module structure.

### 2. Let’s Configure the Job
You’ll be prompted to enter a name for your job and define the maximum number of records per extraction batch. This helps control performance and manage large datasets.

### 3. Choose the SAP Module
Select the SAP module you wish to import:
-  ``` SD ``` (Sales and Distribution)
-  ``` PS ```  (Project System)
-  ``` pp ```  (Production Planning)
-  ``` MM ```  (Materials Management)
-  ``` CO ```  (Controlling)


Once selected, the system will display all the required tables and nodes that will be generated based on that module.
