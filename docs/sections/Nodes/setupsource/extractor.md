## Configuring a Node for SAP ABAP Extractors

When setting up a node to extract data from SAP using an ABAP extractor, you‚Äôll follow a series of steps to define the source, context, and extraction parameters. This setup is essential to ensure that data is retrieved correctly and efficiently from the SAP environment.

### 1. Select Extractor Type
Start by indicating that the type of extraction is an ‚ÄúExtractor.‚Äù
This sets the node to expect SAP-compatible structures and logic, such as delta-enabled extractions.

### 2. Choose the Context
Select the context in which your extractor operates. Available options include:

| Item | Description | 
|----------|----------|
| **Datasource / Extractor (SAPI):**  | Traditional SAP extractors from the SAPI framework.|
| **Core Data Service ABAP (ABAP_CDS):** | CDS views that offer modern modeling features.|
| **SAP Change Data Capture (ABAP_CDC):**  | For real-time or near-real-time change tracking.|
| **NetWeaver Business Warehouse (BW):** | Extractors from SAP BW systems.|
| **HANA Information Views (HANA):** | Views from HANA native environments.|

The selected context determines the available extractors and supported configuration features.

### 3. Select an Extractor
Once the context is chosen, you‚Äôll be prompted to choose the specific extractor from a list provided by the system.
This is typically a list of extractors available based on your SAP connection and credentials.

### 4. Add Variables
You can now add variables to parameterize the extractor.

üõà Reminder: Use variables to filter or scope the data extraction ‚Äî for example, by date, company code, or region. These variables are passed as input parameters to the extractor.


### 5. Select Load Mode
Choose how the data will be extracted:

- Full Load: Extracts the entire dataset each time.

- Delta Load: Extracts only new or changed records since the last execution (only available for delta-enabled extractors).

<Admonition type="tip">
Delta mode is ideal for performance and incremental updates in recurring extractions.

### 6. Edit Filters (Optional)
You may configure filters to restrict the dataset returned by the extractor.

üõà Reminder: Filters allow you to narrow down the result set directly within the extraction logic ‚Äî this is useful for optimizing performance or testing smaller data slices.
